- Repair wifimanager from ESP8266


Features release 6.1.7 (December 27, 2019)
- Repair bugs for DNS
- Enable internal T-Beam sensors to output values in "raw" format. 
See configNode.h and _sensors.ino

Features release 6.1.5 (December 20, 2019)
- Bug fix for "#define _DUSB 0"
- Added number of times a node has been called to the history records listSeen
- Fix LastSeen issues.
- Added 3 Indian frequencies as published by TTN
- Changes configGway.h to contain better info
- Added a message console on the GUI page (_define _MONITOR 1)
- Changed the DNS code to allow .local domains with MDNS
- Added buttons for Expert mode, Monitor and Last Seen.
- Added code for "REBOOT" to be used from the API only *http://your_IP/REBOOT '
- Added the IP to the www server header (visible in browser).
- Removed version 5 of pi-out as it is the same as version 4.
- Added "monitor" functions. This allows to write to monitor screen on browser or use 
USB for desbugging messages.

Features release 6.1.4 (November 25, 2019)
- Compacting Code and Solve Errors
- Look at _DUSB define and add to Serial.print directive where not found
- Renewed the GPS functions, changed "Serial1" to "sGps" to avoid double definitions.
- Downloaded TinyGPS++ library. All working on my T-Beam again.

Features release 6.1.3 (November 20, 2019)
- Made changes to _TRUSTED_NODES in _wwwServer.ino to make sure only named nodes are 
displayed when the value of trusted nodes in "Gateways Settings" has value 2. 
The value of this vaiable is stored in the filesystem of the Gateway SPIFFS andwith every startup of 
the Gateway it is read so that users can access when sensors last were seen by the Gateway 
even after reboots.
Note: all messages ARE handled by gateway but not shown in the user interface "Last Seen" 
under message history.
- Used id_print in _loraFiles.ino in order to avoid _DUSB issues
- Reorganized the conigGway.h file to move items that normally do not change to the end of file.
- Repaired bugs and writing errors

Features release 6.1.1 (November 6, 2019)
- Added "last seen" for a node. An overview when each known node has last been seen by the gateway,
	This would mean that a node that does not fit in the regular history overview would still be visible
	even when it has been seen three days ago.
- Changed name of the ESP-sc-gway.h file into configGway.h and removed most privacy info. 
  This way, whis fie does need less editing and allows faster releasing. 
- Also moved sensor.h into configNode.h and devided between both configXXX.h file.
- Added the documentation for release 6.1.1 and correctd a number of typos.
- Corrected bug for ipPrint() in _wwwServer.ino
- Updated code to read and write config file at the setup() of the gateway, and more often if
	variables are updated in the web server.

Features release 6.1.0 (October 20, 2019)
- Changed name of the ESP-sc-gway.h file into configGway.h and removed most privacy info. 
  This way, whis fie does need less editing and allows faster releasing
- Removed lib from the library directory for libs that are present in the library manager of the node.
- Changed name of sensor.h file into configNode.h and added all privacy configuration info such as SSID, 
  WiFi password, node data etc.
- Display the IP of the Gateway node 5 seconds prior to passing the first message. 
So please keep on the line if you do not know your IP.
- Edit all files and make ready for publising to Github with correct version number
- Change the country/region setting of the Gateway (As a result you probably have to update most of 
  the package).
- Upon connecting over WiFi, display the address for 4 seconds before starting the Gateway function.
- Made a (not complete) list of lib info in the README.md document.
- Correct (again) some typos

New features in version 5.3.4 (March 25, 2019)
- Make use of the latest Arduino IDE available version 1.8.21
- Added new iteams to the statc function so that it now has all the Package Statistics. 
  Fields are such as: mesg_ttl, msg_ttl_0 etc. Removed reference to the old counters.
- !!! Changed Json version in the IDE to ArduinoJSON 6 in _txRx.ino
- Larger message history for ESP32 based on free heap

New features in version 5.3.3 (August 25, 2018)
- Bug Fixing SPIFFS Format in GUI

- Added expert mode button in GUI (Wifi, System and Interrupt data is only shown in expert mode)
- bug fixes and documentation

New features in version 5.3.2 (July 07, 2018)
- Support for local decoding of sensor messages received by the gateway. 
	Use #define _LOCALSERVER 1, to enable this functionality. Also specify for each node that you want
	to inspect the messages from the NwkSKey and AppSKey in the sensor.h file.
	NOTE: the heap of the ESP32 is much larger than of the ESP8266. SO please be careful not to add 
	too many features to the "old" gateway modules
- As a result reworked the sensor functions and changes such as adding/changing DevAddrm NwkSKEY 
	and AppSKey parameters to several functions
- Several in-line documentaton enhancements and typos were fixed

New features in version 5.3.1 (June 30, 2018)
- Included support for T-Beam board including on board GPS sensor (_sensor.ino). #define GATEWAYNODE 1 will

	Included frequency setting in the configGway.h file

(included in iTunes) and you will see the network port in the "Port" section of your IDE.

New features in version 4.0.4 (June 24, 2017):

- Review of the _wwwServer.ino file. Repaired some of the bugs causing crashes of the webserver.
- Updated the README.md file with more cofniguration information

New features in version 4.0.3 (June 22, 2017):

- Added CMAC functions so that the sensor functions work as expected over TTN
- Webserver prints a page in chunks now, so that memory usage is lower and more heap is left over

  for dio0 and dio1 for two or more interrupt lines (better performance for automatic SF setting?)

  dynamic setting thorugh the web interface. Level 3 and 4 will show more info
  on sf, rssi, interrupt flags etc.
- Tested on Arduino IDE 1.18.0

survice reboots and resets of the ESP8266

- Possibility to set the Frequency in the web interface
- Reset the Framecounter in te webinterface

New features in version 3.2.2 (December 29, 2016)):

- Repair the situation where WIFIMANAGER was set to 0 in the configGway.h file. 
The sketch would not compile which is now repaired
- The compiler would issue a set of warnings related to the ssid and passw setting in the configGway.h file. 
Compiler was complaining (and it should) because char* were statically initialised and modified in the code.

New features in version 3.2.1 (December 20, 2016)):

- Repair the status messages to the server. All seconds, minutes, hours etc. are now reported in 2 digits. 
The year is reported in 4 digits.

New features in version 3.2.0 (December 08, 2016)):

- Several bugfixes

New features in version 3.1 (September 29, 2016)):

- In the configGway.h it is possible to set the gateway as sensor node as well. 
	Just set the DevAddr and AppSKey in the _sensor.ino file and be able to forward any sensor or other 
	values to the server as if they were coming from a LoRa node.
- If the #define _STRICT_1CH is set (to 1) then the system will be able to send downlink messages 
	to LoRa nodes that are strict 1-channel devices (all frequencies but frequency 0 are disabled 
	and Spreading Factor (SF) is fixed to one value).
- Code clean-up. The code has been made smaller in the area of loraWait() functions and where the 
	radio is initiated for receiving of transmitting messages.
- Several small bug fixes
- Licensing, the license has been changed to MIT

New features in version 3.0 (September 27, 2016):

- Supports SF7, SF8. SF7 is tested for downstream communication
- Listens on configurable frequency and spreading factor
- Send status updates to server (keepalive)
- PULL_DATA messages to server
